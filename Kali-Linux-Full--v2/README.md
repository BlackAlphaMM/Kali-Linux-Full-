# Kali-Linux-Full-v2
Bash script to install common 3rd party tools in Kali Linux, and also update OS. Includes software tools, Python libraries, and OS 
updates all in one script. v2 is an updated version adding a few more tools I have found useful for pentesting and development. v2 
version also performs cleanup of old software and files.
